        <li>400g can chopped tomatoes with garlic</li>
        <li>900ml chicken stock</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>

        Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan or wok. <br>
        Add the onion and soften for 5 mins.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>
        Add the smoked paprika, thyme and paella rice, stir for 1 min, <br>
        then splash in the sherry, if using. Once evaporated, <br>
        stir in the chopped tomatoes and chicken stock.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>
        Season and cook, uncovered, for about 15 mins, <br>

        and still surrounded with some liquid.

        Stir in the seafood mix and cover with a lid. Simmer for 5 mins, <br>
        or until the seafood is cooked through and the rice is tender. <br>

        and serve with the lemon wedges.
